# Tifa Piano

## Overview
This is a mini version of a virtual piano with eight musical notes using the tonic sol-fa notation: Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, Ti, Do. 

## Project Idea
The idea came from one of my favourite games: Final Fantasy 7. The concept of this playable piano website is inspired by the side quest of returning to Nibelheim to play on Tifa's piano to obtain her ultimate Limit Break. In the game, the song is: <br>

Similarly, on this piano website, the song can be played by pressing the keys on the keyboard: d, r, m, t, l, d, r, m, s, f, d, t, d. 
Alternatively, the song can be played by using the mouse to click on the keys on screen. 

Tifa's piano from the original game brings back tons of memories. In order to share that nostalgia, especially in light of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake, old and new fans alike can play the song once again.
